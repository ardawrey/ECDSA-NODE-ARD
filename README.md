# ECDSA-NODE-ARD
Ethereum Developer Bootcamp ECDSA-NODE Project

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

Client
The client folder contains a react app using vite. To get started, follow these steps:

Open up a terminal in the /client folder
Run npm install to install all the depedencies
Run npm run dev to start the application
Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/
Server
The server folder contains a node.js server using express. To run the server, follow these steps:

Open a terminal within the /server folder
Run npm install to install all the depedencies
Run node index to start the server
The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

Hint - Use nodemon instead of node to automatically restart the server on any changes.
